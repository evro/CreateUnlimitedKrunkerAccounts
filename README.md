# CreateUnlimitedKrunkerAccounts
This code is made in Python, you must install selenium, chrome driver, and a runner / builder that will run your code for you.

I have plans in the future to bypass the "Doing that too much. Refresh." soon.

BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT change "driver = webdriver.Chrome('/Users/Win10v370.PLCHNET/Downloads/chromedriver')"
to this driver = webdriver.Chrome('/Users/YOURLOGINUSERNAMEHERE/Downloads/chromedriver')

it was a small mistake i forgot to put in after testing.
